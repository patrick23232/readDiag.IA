# readDiag & 
# machine learning for Radiance Channel Selection

This is a version of readDiag that utilizes machine learning methods (Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, XGBoost) from the scikit-learn library. It is employed for radiance channel selection, utilizing data from AMSU-A and IASI (in the near future) diagnostics files. This project is part of Patrick dos Santos CÃ¢mara's master's degree. The installation process is the same as explained below, as the requirements.txt file contains all library versions used in this project (scikit-learn, seaborn).

readDiag is a Python package that provides a class to read and plot the [Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/gridpoint-statistical-interpolation-gsi) diagnostics files. It can be used to retrieve and investigate important information from the data assimilation process:

## Installation

Use either `conda` or `python -m venv` to setup a virtual environment to install readDiag:

```
conda create -n readDiag python=3.9.18
conda activate readDiag
pip install readDiag
```

or

```
python -m venv readDiag
source readDiag/bin/activate
pip install readDiag
```

**Note:** When using `python -m venv` make sure to have Python >=3.9.18 installed on your system. For more information on how to use readDiag, take a look at the project's [documentation](https://gad-dimnt-cptec.github.io/readDiag/).
